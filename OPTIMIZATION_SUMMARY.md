## Build Results Comparison

### Before Optimization:
```
File sizes after gzip:
  97.05 kB  build\static\js\main.js
  7.53 kB   build\static\css\main.css
```

### After Optimization:
```
File sizes after gzip:
  81.13 kB  build\static\js\main.js (-16.4%)
  5.84 kB   build\static\css\main.css (-22.4%)
  + Multiple smaller chunks for better caching
```
